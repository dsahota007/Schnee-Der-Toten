# Schnee Der Toten (Created In Unity Engine)

This 1-bit winter-themed survival game was created in 72 hours during a game jam. 
Set in complete darkness, players must throw glowing snowballs to briefly illuminate 
their surroundings while fending off waves of four unique enemies. The minimalist 
black-and-white pixel art enhances the eerie, cold atmosphere, making survival a challenge as 
enemies emerge from the shadows. With each wave, the difficulty increases, requiring strategic 
use of light and movement to stay alive.
